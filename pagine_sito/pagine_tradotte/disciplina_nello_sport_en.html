            <p><a href="./index_en.html">Discipline</a> plays a fundamental role in the development of an athlete, both physically and mentally. It’s not just about following the rules of the game, but about maintaining a constant attitude of commitment, sacrifice, and self-control. Every sport requires frequent and repetitive — often tiring — training sessions that test an individual's willpower. Without discipline, it's easy to give in to laziness or frustration when results don't come quickly.  
                A disciplined athlete, on the other hand, trains consistently, listens to the coach’s advice, maintains proper nutrition and rest, and approaches every competition with seriousness. Even in difficult times — such as injuries, defeats, or pressure — discipline becomes an anchor that helps them not to give up. This mindset builds not only athletic performance over time, but also the athlete's personality: more responsible, determined, and resilient.</p>
            <p>Discipline is also crucial in team life: it fosters respect for others, cooperation, and self-control. Without it, true team spirit cannot exist. In short, discipline is not only a means to becoming a good athlete, but a real school of life that shapes stronger, more balanced, and more self-aware individuals.</p>
